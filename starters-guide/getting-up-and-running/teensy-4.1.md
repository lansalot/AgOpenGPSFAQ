# Teensy 4.1

The brains of the AOG board is the Teensy 4.1, and these are a little hard to find. You want to make sure you get one that DOES have ethernet tho, as it is also available without.

A good place to start your hunt is here: [https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

Make sure the one you order has the chip highlighted in red - that's ethernet.

Also, you'll need some long 2mm pitch headers to solder to the board for it to reach to connector on your PCB.
