# Tablet

You want a tablet that's rugged and has a screen that won't be impaired in direct sunlight. The Panasonic Toughpad range can be bought very cheaply, refurbished, on ebay.

Look for one with at least 8gb memory, preferably an SSD hard drive and if you can find one with built-in ethernet all the better (otherwise you'll need a USB dongle to connect it to the AOG board).

The CF-D1 is a great buy.
