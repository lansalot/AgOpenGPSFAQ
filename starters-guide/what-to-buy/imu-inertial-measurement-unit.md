# IMU (inertial measurement unit)

The BNO085 is the one to go for - no other is as good. The Adafruit is popular, but if you look at any kind of alternative, the pins have to be in the same configuration - so play it safe and stick with this. These can be hard to find, so watch the Discourse or Telegram channels as helpful members often post when they see stock at $VENDOR.
