# Help! I need to speak to someone!

Before you look for help either on Discourse, please check this book itself, the information here will be kept as up to date as possible. It's under construction, but in time, it should hopefully become the go-to resource for all issues.

In other words.. the problem you're having has likely been encountered by someone already, so it could be in the FAQ section or the "Problems and Solution" section. There's a search at the top too.

If you just fancy a chat, then there's a great community of people willing to help you, You can join the Discourse forum here:
